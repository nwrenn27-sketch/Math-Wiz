# Math Wiz — Investor Pitch Deck
### Google Slides Content | Copy slide-by-slide

## SLIDE 1 — Title Slide

**Headline:** Math Wiz

**Subheadline:** The calculus tutor that teaches you *how* to think, not just what to do.

**Visual suggestion:** Dark blue-to-purple gradient background (match the app's header). White text. Logo or app screenshot centered.

**Speaker note:** Hook: "Most students don't fail calculus because they're not smart enough. They fail because they never had a tutor sitting next to them explaining each step. Math Wiz fixes that."

---

## SLIDE 2 — The Problem

**Headline:** Calculus is the biggest academic roadblock in STEM

**Three bullet points:**
- **30%** of college students drop STEM majors — calculus is cited as the #1 reason *(ACT research)*
- Tutoring costs **$80–$150/hour** and is inaccessible for most students
- Textbooks show *answers* — they don't teach *reasoning*

**Visual suggestion:** Split image — left side: frustrated student at desk. Right side: empty tutoring office with high price sign.

**Speaker note:** This isn't a niche problem. 750,000+ students take Calculus I every year in the US alone.

---

## SLIDE 3 — The Solution

**Headline:** Math Wiz: AI-powered, step-by-step calculus coaching

**Three columns:**

| What it does | How it's different | Why it works |
|---|---|---|
| Guides students through 8 calculus topics | Reveals solutions *one step at a time* | Forces active recall, not passive reading |
| Interactive diagrams for every problem | Explains the *why*, not just the *how* | Mirrors how a real tutor teaches |
| Instant answer checking with feedback | No subscription, no login required | Zero friction to start learning |

**Visual suggestion:** App screenshot of the solver screen — showing the step-by-step reveal in action.
